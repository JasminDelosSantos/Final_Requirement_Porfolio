                <h5>Future <span>Web Developer</span></h5>
                <p>I am Jasmin Delos Santos, a 21-year-old third-year BSIT student at Polytechnic University of the Philippines. I am the kind of person who always strives to complete tasks as soon as they are assigned to me. Although I wasn't initially drawn to Programming or Web Development, I decided to pursue this course/program based on my parents' recommendation. However, as I progress through my studies, I am gradually developing a passion for it. This program has been quite challenging, but it has taught me to believe in myself and tackle any challenges or tasks that come my way.</p>
